## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### First time for new project

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create TO_DO_LIST
npx wrangler@latest d1 create DATABASE
npm run typecheck
npx wrangler d1 migrations create DATABASE todo
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DATABASE --remote
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Previewing the Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

Deployment is done using the Wrangler CLI.

To build and deploy directly to production:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

To deploy a preview URL:

```sh
npx wrangler versions upload
```

You can then promote a version to production after verification or roll it out progressively.

```sh
npx wrangler versions deploy
```
